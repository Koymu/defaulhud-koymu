hello thank you for downloading my hud!!
just one thing to addon to have the full experience and look of my hud.

if u have a config file put in the command 

hud_deathnotice_time 0 

^^^^^^^^^^
this will basically disable the killfeed and I personally like it 
because it gives you a cleaner look and there is not any clutter.

if ur not a fan of it, I reccomend just leaving it default
